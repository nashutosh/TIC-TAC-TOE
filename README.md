This script creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game using Tkinter.
The game features a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. 
Players take turns clicking buttons to place their symbol ("X" or "O").
The game checks for a win after each move, and if a player wins, a message box announces the winner and the game exits.
